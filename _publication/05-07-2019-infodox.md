We argue that the resolution to the black hole information paradox lies in a proper accounting of the implications of diffeomorphism invariance for the Hilbert space and observables of quantum gravity. The setting of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime is adopted for most of the paper, but in the framework of canonical quantum gravity, without invoking AdS/CFT duality. We present Marolf's argument that boundary unitarity is a consequence of diffeomorphism invariance, and show that its failure to apply in the classical limit results from a lack of analyticity that has no quantum counterpart. We argue that boundary unitarity leads to a {\it boundary information paradox}, which generalizes the black hole information paradox and arises in virtually any scattering process. We propose a resolution that involves operators of the boundary algebra that redundantly encode information about physics in the bulk, and explain why such redundancy need not violate the algebraic no cloning theorem. We also argue that the infaller paradox, which has motivated the firewall hypothesis for black hole horizons, is ill-posed in quantum gravity, because it ignores essential aspects of the nature of the Hilbert space and observables in quantum gravity.
