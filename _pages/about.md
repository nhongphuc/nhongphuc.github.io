I am a data scientist and machine learning researcher with a strong foundation in theoretical physics. My work sits at the intersection of **statistical learning, probabilistic modeling, and scientific computing**, where I focus on building models that are both **mathematically principled and practically effective**.

I was originally trained as a theoretical physicist, which shaped the way I approach problems: starting from first principles, identifying symmetries and constraints, and reasoning carefully about uncertainty, approximation, and scalability. Over time, I transitioned toward data science and machine learning, where I now apply these ideas to real-world problems involving complex, high-dimensional data.

My technical interests include:
- Probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference  
- Maximum entropy methods, information theory, and statistical physics  
- Monte Carlo methods (MCMC, Langevin dynamics)  
- Deep learning, with an emphasis on interpretable and equivariant models  
- Scientific and numerical computing in Python (NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch)

I enjoy working on problems where **theory informs algorithms**, such as designing efficient samplers, understanding the behavior of learning dynamics, or incorporating physical or structural constraints into machine learning models. I am particularly interested in settings where approximate inference, symmetry, or uncertainty quantification play a central role.

In addition to applied work, I actively develop and maintain open-source tools related to entropy, divergence measures, and probabilistic modeling, and I enjoy communicating technical ideas through writing and research-oriented discussions.

I am currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute as a **senior or research-oriented data scientist / ML engineer**, especially in teams that value strong mathematical intuition, clean abstractions, and rigorous thinking.
