We consider excited states in a CFT, obtained by applying a weak unitary perturbation to the vacuum. The perturbation is generated by the integral of a local operator $J^{(n)}$ of modular weight n over a spacelike surface passing through x=0. For |n|≥2 the modular Hamiltonian associated with a division of space at x=0 picks up an endpoint contribution, sensitive to the details of the perturbation (including the shape of the spacelike surface) at x=0. The endpoint contribution is a sum of light-ray moments of the perturbing operator $J^{(n)}$ and its descendants. For perturbations on null planes only moments of $J^{(n)}$ itself contribute.
